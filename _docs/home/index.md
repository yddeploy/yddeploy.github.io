### Overview
FedScale is a scalable and extensible open-source federated learning (FL) engine. It provides high-level APIs to implement FL algorithms, deploy them at scale across diverse hardware and software backends, and evaluate them at scale. FedScale also includes the largest FL benchmark that contains FL tasks ranging from image classification and object detection to language modeling and speech recognition. Moreover, it provides datasets to faithfully emulate FL training environments where FL will realistically be deployed.

### Package Installation

#### Quick Installation (Linux)

You can simply run `install.sh`.

```
source install.sh # Add `--cuda` if you want CUDA 
pip install -e .
```

Update `install.sh` if you prefer different versions of conda/CUDA.

#### Installation from Source (Linux/MacOS)

If you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#download-section) installed and cloned FedScale, here are the instructions.
```
cd FedScale

# Please replace ~/.bashrc with ~/.bash_profile for MacOS
echo export FEDSCALE_HOME=$(pwd) >> ~/.bashrc 
echo alias fedscale=\'bash $FEDSCALE_HOME/fedscale.sh\' >> ~/.bashrc 
conda init bash
. ~/.bashrc

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fedscale
pip install -e .
```

Finally, install NVIDIA [CUDA 10.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) or above if you want to use FedScale with GPU support.
