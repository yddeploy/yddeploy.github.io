We describe more details about many other FL datasets. We provide realistic client mappings, and the train and val partitions of each dataset, using the following format by default: 
```
dataset/
├── client_data_mapping
│   └── *.csv for client data mapping and train/test splitting
```


Note that no details were kept of any of the participants age, gender, or location, and random ids are assigned to each individual.

### Description of Datasets

---
#### Taxi Trajectory Prediction
This dataset describes a complete year (from 01/07/2013 to 30/06/2014) of the trajectories for all the 442 taxis (clients) running in the city of Porto, in Portugal. 
In this task, we may build a predictive framework that is able to infer the final destination of taxi rides based on their (initial) partial trajectories. Details of features are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pkdd-15-predict-taxi-service-trajectory-i/overview).

#### Puffer
Puffer data comprises different measurements of the Internet network bandwidth in video streaming — each measurement contains a different set of time-series data collected on Puffer servers, and is dumped as a CSV file. We select the data of the first week data of 2021.
